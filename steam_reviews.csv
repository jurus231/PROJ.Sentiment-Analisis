"In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend the game at all, the major changes done in the last year are not good, matchmaking system is going from bad to worse and the report system is beyond broken, penalizing you for speaking against bad plays or teammates. It used to be so much better in the past, ranked matches are horrendous now, turbo games are way more fun and laid back.",negative

"People usually compare DOTA to abusive relationships: you kind of unintentionally know and understand  that it has to finish sooner or later, but it is so comforting, addictive, and “adrenaliny” that even those who have courage to end (delete) it, usually come back after some time for that “high” (I absolutely hate and absolutely love you) feeling. 

For me, DOTA is more like a therapy: when im in the darkest state of mind, when I experience trauma in life, or when I am simply frustrated, I always return to DOTA for that “time travel until better days” kind of vibe. 

DOTA helps me relax by being a very engaging, focus, strategy, and right-decision-oriented game where I feel needed and useful (especially when I miss these feelings in real life). There is no other game like that.",positive

"Introduction
Dota 2 is an iconic multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve Corporation. Released in 2013, the game is the successor to the Warcraft III: Defense of the Ancients (DotA) modification and has since grown into one of the main esports titans. Its complex gameplay, endless strategic depth, and active community make it a unique phenomenon in the gaming industry.

Gameplay: Skill vs. Tactics
Dota 2 is based on battles between two teams of five players, the goal of which is to destroy the enemy ""fortress"" (Ancient), while protecting their own. Each player controls a unique hero with a set of abilities that develop during the match. Here, not only reaction and mechanical skill are important, but also team coordination, choice of tactics, and map control.

- Heroes and roles: More than 120 heroes with different roles (tanks, support, carry, mages) allow you to endlessly experiment with combinations.
- Items and Progression: Gold and XP earned in combat unlock powerful items and upgrades, adding layers of strategy.

- Match Dynamics: Games last between 20 and 60 minutes, with the outcome often decided in decisive team skirmishes.

Graphics and Sound: Functionality and Atmosphere
Dota 2 doesn’t strive for photorealism, but its vibrant art style and detailed maps have stood the test of time. Regular visual updates and ability effects are pleasing to the eye. The sound design perfectly complements the gameplay: unique hero lines, ability cues, and epic music at critical moments enhance immersion.

Features and Community
- Free-to-Play: All in-game benefits are available without paying. Purchases only concern cosmetics (skins, animations), which maintains balance.
- Esports: The International tournament attracts millions of viewers every year, and prize pools reach tens of millions of dollars. - Tutorials and Community: The game offers tutorials and modes for beginners, but the steep learning curve means there is a high barrier to entry. The community is active, but sometimes toxic, which is something to consider.

Pros:
+ Incredible strategic depth and replayability.
+ Regular updates and support from Valve.
+ Vibrant esports scene and spectacular tournaments.
+ Fair monetization without pay-to-win.

Cons:
- Complexity for beginners: requires time to master the mechanics and meta.
- Potentially toxic players in public matches.
- Match lengths can be tiring.

Conclusion
Dota 2 is a game for those willing to dedicate time to learning its mechanics and nuances. It rewards skill, teamwork, and strategic thinking, while remaining one of the most complex and intense MOBAs on the market. If you're looking for a challenge, want to dive into the eSports culture, or just enjoy fast-paced tactical battles, Dota 2 is worth a try. However, those who prefer casual gameplay or are afraid of high difficulty may want to consider other titles in the genre.",positive

as I enter near 30s nothing beats the nostalgia of this classic game.,positive
don't waste your time. only way this game is playable is if you started playing when it first came out day 1 and gradually learned the characters and items as they were added. don't know why they bothered with the piece of shit beginner mode  that doesn't teach you shit. no way to learn the game. ether you will play the beginner mode until it doesn't let you anymore or you will finally join a game and within 30 seconds realize you need to watch 50 hours of videos to actual learn what you need to play the fucking game. who ever was in charge of the beginner mode and all the workers who worked on the beginner mode should be forced to watch their families rot. its beyond a crime how bad it is to try and play this game. hope some hero levels the building they work at.,negative
"Dota to LOL is like LOL to Pokemon Unite. All good games but Pokemon Unite is entry, for people missing braincells. LOL is moderate for people with damaged brain cells. Dota is expert for people with no cognitive decline or disabilities. If it's too hard then I advise playing LOL due to your lack of or damaged brain cells. If that's too hard, then I guess enjoy pushing bottom with Sylveon.",positive

"I've been playing this game for over 15 years (since the original DotA). The game itself is great, but the PLAYER BEHAVIOR SUMMARY system is incredibly frustrating. I can't use voice or text chat, yet my behavior score keeps getting worse. I don't even have voice chat enabled — soon I won't be able to type either. It feels like the system doesn't actually allow your score to improve, even when other players commend you.

I genuinely feel sorry for the Dota community. If this continues, I believe long-time, dedicated players will find the game unplayable. I hope Steam takes this issue seriously before it drives away loyal players.",negative

"[h1]Dota 2: A Beautiful Disaster[/h1]

Dota 2 is the ultimate teamwork game for ten psychiatric patients fighting not just the enemy but each other. In theory, it’s a 5v5 strategy game. In practice, it’s a chaotic battleground where allies [b]flame harder than enemies[/b], supports forget they’re supports, and everyone slowly loses their grip on reality.

Every match is a new [i]psychological experiment[/i]. Who will tilt first? Who will throw the game hardest? And in the end, only one mentally intact player may remain, if any.

Play Dota 2 where losing isn’t just likely, [u]it’s emotionally devastating[/u]. And your teammates will make sure you never forget whose fault it was.

"it really works your decision making and your budgeting for the items you want . you cant really rush in and the strats that take place is insane . its takes a bit to get used to and when i saw the 100 hour rank opening i though it was too much, but after spending some time playing, i understand. the game has alot of trouble with people leaving in the middle or just not doing what they need to for the team . overall i recommend this game if you love making your own hero with different stats and love team play, and if you got alot of time in your hands lmao",positive

",positive
"want to enjoy the game but just can't, every game is at least 30 min long normally 40. Trying to learn the game will just involve you getting stomped every single game since the matchmaking sucks due to there being very few new players. Starting out at least, every game is just a 40 minute slog where one team stomps the other because of matchmaking. People will reccommend you do swift play but eventually youll switch to unranked norms and have this experience for at least 50-100 games. For reference just getting 50 30 min games under your belt will take you about 1500 hours and most likely you still wont be good or even decent according to most. The game's just too old for a new player to come in and compete with the players that have thousands or tens of thousands of hours

Also the community will not support you. It's very difficult to find people who want to play with you in discord. Like most MOBAs the player base is largely toxic and will be rude to you almost every game.",negative

"Don't even play dota2 if you are mentally weak or just play once or twice a week. Current state of dota is just so toxic where the griefers got 0 reports while those that who are talking in chat get muted as long as other players reported in game either toxic chat or without even one curse word. Dota2 currently filled with bunch of people who dont dare to talk anymore due to this kind of hidden rules cuz everyone know that talking will bring not only reports but at the same time griefer will just play the game and griefs continuously. What I meant by griefers are those bots who have 0 idea on how to play, standing base, afk, not placing wards properly or even those without a medals can play ranked game with ranked player. It is so hard to report those griefers and way more easier for gaben to punish those who are talking, this game favors those player shut up and play, although got griefers just shut up and play",negative

"Somewhere between the silence of midnight and the cold glow of my screen,
I found a place that doesn’t ask questions.
No explanations. No expectations. Just... quiet.
Out there, victory means nothing. Loss means nothing.
What matters is that the voices fade. The faces blur.
No one waits for me there. No one wonders why I’ve changed.
And maybe that’s the point.
I don’t play to win.
I play to disappear.

"The perfect game if you’ve ever thought, “I want to be emotionally devastated by strangers from around the world in under 40 minutes.” It’s not just a game — it’s a lifestyle of regret, rage, and reinstalling.

The tutorial? Oh, you mean that vague memory from 2013? Don’t worry, you’ll learn everything you need to know when a guy named “420SniperMain” screams at you in all chat because you didn’t stack at precisely 53.75 seconds.

Let’s not forget the matchmaker, which appears to operate on the principle of chaos theory. Sometimes you get matched with a pro. Other times, you get someone who just discovered their mouse has two buttons. Spice of life!

And the gameplay — absolutely thrilling. Nothing quite compares to the joy of carrying your entire team for 50 minutes, only to lose because someone thought it’d be a great time to try out a new build. On ranked. With Techies.

Graphics? Stunning. Especially when you’re lying dead for 110 seconds wondering why you came back to this game again.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely — if you’re into Stockholm Syndrome and digital masochism.

10/10, would cry in low priority again.",positive

"If you're looking for a game that truly challenges your mind and decision-making, Dota 2 is one of the best out there. It’s not just a game; it’s a brain workout.

Every match is different. You have to think ahead, adapt to your enemies, and communicate with your team. Whether you're drafting heroes, making split-second decisions in fights, or managing resources, Dota 2 pushes you to think smart and act fast.

Yes, it has a steep learning curve, but once you start to understand the mechanics and strategies, it becomes incredibly rewarding. The feeling of outplaying your opponents or turning the game around with teamwork and good calls is unmatched.

If you're someone who enjoys strategy, competition, and personal growth, I highly recommend giving Dota 2 a try. Just be prepared—it’s a game that uses your brain a lot, but that’s what makes it amazing.

"A Long Journey Ending in Disappointment

I've been part of the Dota universe for nearly 20 years, starting from the original mod and sticking with it all the way through Dota 2. Sadly, I have to say—this game has become one of the most toxic experiences in gaming. The community is relentlessly negative, and the gameplay, while deeply addictive, often feels like a complete waste of time.

At this point, I can no longer justify the emotional toll it takes. The highs are brief, and the lows are frequent and draining. After investing so many years, it’s tough to walk away, but it’s time. I'm permanently deleting it in an effort to break free from what has become an unhealthy cycle.

I wouldn’t recommend Dota 2 to anyone. It’s not worth the frustration, especially when there are better ways to spend your time and energy.",negative

You got try hard's in newcomer mode ruining the experience for players who are trying to learn the game. I AM NOT NEW TO MOBA'S but I've never played DOTA 2 that much and wanted to finally get a feel for the game. It is a complete disaster with uninspired characters. League of Legends is the best MOBA to exist and I'm glad I don't have to waste my life playing this miserable game. Stick to Half Life and Counter Strike Valve you ain't cut out for the MOBA genre leave it to RIOT they are the kings of MOBA'S. Nothing will ever dethrone League of legends. This game is a complete and utter confusing mess that doesn't help you in any way shape or form .. Terrible dogsh*t game.",negative

But I appreciated that all the heroes are free, and in the online match I played, the random I was laning with very politely explained to me what I should be doing, which was nice, because I could tell he was pulling his hair out internally and a league player would probably have used much stronger language by that point.",positive

i love this game :heart:,positive
"Am I ever going to be any good at this game? Probably not. Do I enjoy playing it? That depends. It's pretty normal to have toxic mfrs in games like this, and I try (and fail) not to be one of them. It's a skill game and I got a skill issue. It doesn't have to be everyone else's problem though! I don't know if I'll ever be good enough to call myself decent, but when a game is going REALLY well and my partner shouts ""Great play!"" to me, I get all the good feels. 

Support characters are my bread and butter. I love that there's a lot of really fun, cute and interesting female heroes to choose from. I also LOVE how customizeable the looks are, so I'm able to make my characters really glow and sparkle as annoyingly as my little clown heart desires. 

I never had played games like this before I started dating my partner in 2021. Didn't understand the appeal. After watching him play for a year, I started playing too. I have found that I do love this game, even without any talent and skill of my own. I've never been into sports at all, but I love THIS sport. Dunno. It's hard, there's a vast learning curve. Just don't give up!!!

To sum this game (and my experience) up in a single sentence: ""It grows on you.""",positive

"Game too good. You will be addicted in no time. You will start losing your normal life, and all you want is playing dota 2. Not recommended if you don't want to be like me",negative
"It's a good game, very similar to the original on War Craft 3 with added improvements.  It's an addicting game, so you will need to monitor your time as it flies by.   The learning curve can be steep for newer players, but it's well worth staying and figuring it out if this suits your game play style.

There are a couple of cons.  One is the time to enter a match.  It can take anywhere from 1-5 minutes to even get into a match.   All players must accept within roughly a 30 second time period, so if you were to step away to go to the bathroom or just be doing something else to waste the time you are penalized for not accepting.  It would be better if you were just in a lobby where players ready up and as soon as the room fills it launched.  This was the way in the War Craft 3 days, and it's probably why the game is struggling to contain a player base.  It's petty to be penalized to enter a match within such a short period.",positive

"“Ah, Dota 2 the game we love to trash-talk yet can’t stop playing. Now seems like the perfect time to write a review.

My Story with Dota 2
I first tried Dota 2 back in 2015, but I wasn’t yet hooked on MOBAs, and my old PC could barely hit 30 fps. After less than ten hours, I gave up and moved on. Then, in 2019 just before COVID-19 hit my friends and I were captivated by OG’s miraculous back-to-back TI championships. Inspired, we decided to give Dota 2 another shot.

We all learned together. I picked offlane while my two friends took carry and mid. We lost our first 25 games in a row, but finally snagged our first win and it felt incredible. Jumping into ranked revealed our weak point: our position 5 support. We lost most games until I swapped from mid (position 3) to full support. It was rough at first, but over time I mastered pulling creeps, timing my item purchases, and ward placement. Soon, we hit a winning streak and had a blast until life got in the way and we all drifted apart. We still plan to reunite for games whenever we can.

What Is Dota 2?
Dota 2 is a top-down, real-time strategy MOBA where two teams of five face off. Each player fills a role:
       1. Carry (Position 1): Needs the most farm and usually dictates late-game fights.
       2. Mid (Position 2): Farms solo in the middle lane for fast levels and often makes play-making rotations after laning.
       3.Offlane (Position 3): A versatile utility role many offlaners initiate fights.
       4.Soft Support (Position 4): Roams between lanes, helps secure runes, and occasionally buys team items.
       5. Hard Support (Position 5): Buys most of the vision (wards) and has the least gold heroes who excel at helping teammates with minimal items.

With a huge roster of heroes and a wide array of items, every match feels different.

New-Player Experience
Dota 2 isn’t exactly newbie friendly. Its steep learning curve and complex mechanics turn many potential fans away before they’ve even had fun. Playing on the SEA server, I also found the community less welcoming to newcomers a real shortcoming in my opinion.

Verdict: 8/10
I give Dota 2 an 8 out of 10. It’s incredibly fun especially with friends but demands significant time and effort to learn. To newcomers: you might actually be happier not playing it! (Just kidding if you’re determined, brace yourself and your mental health.) Enjoy the ride!",positive

"2,000+ hours. I heal, I ward, I save lives.
My carry? 0/9 in 10 minutes, still last hitting with his face.
I ping once — he dives 1v5 and dies again.

Ako na nga ang nag-ward, nag-stack, nag-smoke...
Tapos ang Luna ko may Shadow Blade at 45 mins?
Tangina mo, carry ka, hindi ka Dora the Explorer!

I whisper to myself: “This is fine.”
Then we lose because my core thinks BKB is optional.

Chuck Norris doesn’t play Dota. He supports better.

Would I recommend Dota 2?
Only if you're a masochist with excellent warding habits.

"This game is amazing! The gentlemen are very polite, they will politely tell and show you how to go to the reproductive organ, how horses fucked me, what my stepfather did to me as a child. I am very glad that in this magnificent and never-toxic game there are highly qualified specialists who will diagnose you and identify all your ailments and sores, even if you did not ask. (Apparently very worried)
And oh my God.. I didn't even know my mother was famous! I can almost hear from everyone's lips how beautiful she is!
I also made new friends who very persistently wanted to come to my city and show me how beautiful the forest is and wanted to teach me how to use a shovel. Probably mushroom pickers.
The people here are very kind and understanding. And as they say, “it's common for people to make mistakes,” but you're probably not human, and even BETTER, because if you “make a mistake,” you'll get a lot of emotions and applause from your allies, and a desire to meet you and your mother (yes, she's in my pocket) to shake your hand. I even lost count of how many mothers I actually have. I am the son of a toilet bowl, a porch, a rabbit, a dog, a courtesan, a test tube, a muskrat, a clown, and even a stool.(I didn't even know I had so many mothers, but thanks to the company of this game, I was able to find them.

I have over 10k hours in this game. I have spoken with steam multiple times about my accounts being hacked and skins being traded out for nothing and no one has helped. Now on top of that after winning 7 games today I was randomly thrown into a server that I did not select in a region I have atrocious ping in. I was kicked from the server and given a 2.1/2 minute abandon time. I reset and chose Australia as my region and again was thrown into some random Asian server where my connection kept crashing and now have a 30 minute timer to que. Absolutely ridiculous.,negative

"Ah, Dota 2 — the game that takes five minutes to learn and approximately a decade to tolerate. Valve’s free-to-play masterpiece is less of a game and more of a psychological experiment to see how long humans can endure emotional trauma in 45-minute intervals.

The gameplay? Elegant chaos. You and four random strangers — who you will grow to hate more than your high school group project partners — attempt to coordinate strategy, map control, and hero synergy. Instead, you’ll likely witness jungle farming while your base burns, a “mid or feed” lunatic, and someone typing in Cyrillic who may or may not be summoning a demon.

The community is legendary — not in the wholesome way, but more in the “if Dante wrote a gaming chapter in Inferno” way. You haven’t truly gamed until a Peruvian support player blames your mom for missing a last hit. It's the only game where your IQ drops every time you open team chat, and every “GG” could mean “good game” or “I hope your router catches fire.”

The graphics are beautiful, the mechanics are razor-sharp, and the learning curve is so steep it legally qualifies as a cliff. Every hero has 4 spells, 32 counters, and at least one skin that looks like it belongs in a discount cosplay convention.

And the best part? You’ll be back. Oh yes, you’ll uninstall it, swear off it, maybe touch grass… and then one day, you’ll see a patch note like “Wraith King now has a scepter upgrade that lets him haunt your dreams,” and you’ll be reinstalling faster than Pudge can miss a hook.",positive

If loving Dota 2 is wrong, then I don’t want to be right. This game is like a toxic relationship where the toxicity is actual in-game chat and I keep crawling back because I like the chaos.

Every match is a new adventure: maybe I’ll dominate as Pudge, or maybe I’ll spend 60 minutes being yelled at in Russian while my teammates farm jungle camps like they owe them money. Either way, I'm having the time of my life.

The heroes? Beautifully designed. The mechanics? Impossibly deep. The learning curve? A vertical cliff with barbed wire and fire at the top, but my god do I love the climb.

Sometimes I win. Sometimes I lose. Sometimes I accidentally pick Techies and get reported by my own friends. And yet... I queue up again, because nothing compares to the feeling of a perfect Black Hole or clutch Ravage that turns the tide of battle.

Would I recommend Dota 2?
Absolutely.
Would I recommend Dota 2 to my enemies? Also yes.
Should you play it? Only if you're ready to sell your soul and time to the Ancient.

See you on the battlefield. I’ll be feeding mid.

"I've been playing this game for more than 15 years yet i will not recommend it to new players . It is full with people playing from smurf accounts  , bought accounts  and  the party ranked system is totally busted. You have guys with 1800 mmr  in party with  guys that are on 5k mmr  and ofc your 5k mmr is support .. on the other team their 5k mmr is a core player . Your carry is 1.8 and he has zero idea what the fuck hes doing meanwhile their 5k is farming the shit out of you. i am from Bulgaria and every single fucking game i have to Deal with Russian and Ukrainian players that just refuse to speak english because everybody that speaks english  is  "" American "" Gamburger. The game is beyound toxic and imbalanced . Its shame become i used to love Dota  and would not recommend it to anybody ever .",negative

"this game used to be really fun and enjoyable. However, there have been a huge influx of people playing on other servers to ""boost"" their accounts and has ruined the game. due to not being able to communicate, or the people that jump servers are lower mmr skill based and can not keep up with the rank that they are trying to play. unless valve fixes this, im sure the game will die off just like many other MOBA games that allowed this to happen in their games.

"So I have played a lot of Dota over the past years and honestly I can not recommend this game to anyone anymore for reasons:
1. Smurfing is more of a problem now so more then ever. People buying accounts to play at lower mmr brackets just suck the fun out of the game. You spend 45 minutes of your life in a game you just flat out lose because people arent playing at their rank.. And there is not much in the way to stop this sadly.
2. Toxic players.",negative

"Играю с 2012 года. Если когда-то попадёте в ад, там будет просто отдельная очередь с дотерами, потому что даже черты

За эти годы я:

Постарел на 50 лет морально и физически.

Потерял всех друзей и обзавёлся десятком врагов (причём пятеро из них были в моей последней команде).

Научился ругаться на 15 языках, включая язык жестов и ультразвук.

Разбил 5 клавиатур, 2 мышки и 3 собственных мечты.

Стать экспертом в области психоанализа по пикам союзников.

Категорически не рекомендую эту игру, если у вас есть хоть капля уважения к себе и собственному времени.

"Dota 2 is insanely complex, brutally punishing, and deeply addicting. Every match is a 5v5 war of strategy, mechanics, and mental endurance. The highs? Legendary. The lows? Existential.

The hero variety, teamplay, and depth are unmatched—but so is the toxicity. You'll learn, grow, rage, and queue again. It's not friendly to new players, but for those who stick with it, no other game comes close.

Pros:
✅ Incredibly deep gameplay
✅ 100% free-to-play, no pay-to-win
✅ Unforgettable team moments

Cons:
❌ Steep learning curve
❌ Toxic players galore
❌ 45 minutes of pain if one teammate tilts
